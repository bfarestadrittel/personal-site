        <h2 class="skill-list">Save. Share. Collaborate.</h2>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Backstory</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Save. Share. Collaborate. With those few keywords, the purpose of Blocbox was established. Cloud-based file sharing applications are not uncommon, but this project aimed to create a product that was targeted specifically toward creative people. A specific niche was identified, and I was tasked with creating a product that could serve as an alternative to popular sites such as Dropbox.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Knowing there’s no shortage of competition in the file-sharing space, the best place to start was to look at the services that are the most popular. With a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nsw7V0sCEBA3BF1g-aZY9YJVsWt6LbTIVhm3X_Jb2BQ/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a> I was able to identify some key areas that could be improved on or gaps that could be filled.
      </p>
      <p class="study-copy">
        To ensure the project met the needs of users, I reached out to them directly with a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cuiHlqgUjQrcLHLF2" class="email-link" target="_blank">short survey</a>. From this I was able to gather essential information such as user needs, user behavior and demographics. Here are some of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyfTg0wO3AYBGWywdYph49OsHPOe_fOtaioW2XbOS78/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">the findings</a> from my preliminary research and survey:
      </p>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Traditional methods are the most popular. Most people save content online by bookmarking, saving it to the desktop or simply jotting down a note.</li>
        <li class="problem">Less than half of survey respondents use popular social media accounts to sign in to other accounts.</li>
        <li class="problem">Over two-thirds of survey respondents worked in a collaborative environment, with over 50% often needing to share resources easily.</li>
        <li class="problem">Of those surveyed, 100% had a mobile device and also used their mobile device to browse the internet.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Based on the survey results, I was able to start thinking about how different types of users would interact with Blocbox. To help validate these concepts, I <a href="css/survey-personas.pdf" class="email-link" target="_blank">created several personas</a> that could guide the creation of the product.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Stories</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">With several personas established, I started to narrow the product with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AFB3oDKDT52KRvSiE1i9FfdABBpWD0b7QkRkYwIuKNo/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">user stories</a> to focus on a minimum viable product. Going through the list of user stories, I also sorted them by priority so the design and development process could move quickly and smoothly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Flows</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Knowing the features the Blocbox project should focus on, I started to map them creating user flows for each piece. Because there is substantial competition in this space, the user flows helped me find areas that could be simplified or improved upon.</p>

    </div>
     <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Sitemap</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">The sitemap for Blocbox was very straightforward thanks to the areas I had identified as high priority. However, this step was still important to make sure nothing was left out.</p>
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qR_Usv-5-jcLvM8xUZTBKc8scpL05NHU/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><img src="css/blocbox-sitemap.png" id="user-flow"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Low-Fi Wireframes</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Thanks to the amount of advance preparation done for Blocbox, I was able to start putting together some <a href="https://bloc.mybalsamiq.com/projects/brandonfarestad-rittel/prototype/blocbox-v1?key=82b919050fdccaac99c54a64b3cfb7d89898b0ea" class="email-link" target="_blank">rough designs for key pages with Balsamiq</a>. The areas I focused on were: homepage, onboarding, dashboard and account settings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Colors & Fonts</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Blocbox now had a basic look and feel that could help inform the overall branding. Knowing this was a professional product, I selected a <a href="css/blocbox-colors-final.pdf" class="email-link" target="_blank">blue color palette</a> that would convey a sense of trust. Additionally, I selected fonts that were simple and easy to read to keep with the feel of professionalism.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Logo Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Blocbox was starting to come together, but to have a complete identity it needed a logo. After a page or two of sketches, I decided simplicity would be best in this case. Based on my initial research, users wanted a product that was simple and easy-to-use and the brand identity should reflect that.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Mockup Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Before jumping into the final designs, I put together some black and white prototypes for user testing. While I didn’t have an in-person focus group, I still <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gts2lQdFxzAtaHZ1iruzwazNXWRAhFx37JZS-Pui5KE/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">created a script</a> for my testing that could help users focus on the features I was targeting and guide them through the prototype.</p>
      <p class="solution-copy">The results of the user testing showed that the product was on-track with the features I had focused on. Knowing this I started to create the final designs in Sketch.</p>
      <a href="css/blocbox-design.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="css/blocbox-preview.png" id="user-flow"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Development</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Though some projects only require designs and a prototype, I wanted to get the developers off to a head start by creating some of the key pages with HTML and CSS. To take a closer look at the code, here’s the <a href="https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/blocbox" class="email-link" target="_blank">link to the Blocbox GitHub repo.</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Results</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Though Blocbox was one of the first UX projects I created from start to finish, the importance of research and user testing was quickly evident. The original specs asked for the ability to login through Facebook and Twitter accounts. However, the feedback from users was clear. They did not trust using those accounts or did not want to associate them with this particular product.
      </p>
      <p class="study-copy">
        With that information, I was able to cut those from the design and development process and focus on a simple login process. Had I not conducted as much user testing, this could’ve slowed down the progress with unnecessary, additional work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Even when there are similar products on the market, careful analysis and research can help identify gaps in user experience that can be capitalized on. The biggest challenge in creating Blocbox was differentiating from the well-known products already available.
      </p>

    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">What Worked?</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Surveys and testing. By conducting thorough research I was able to identify what users did and didn’t like to ultimately save a significant amount of time in the design and development process.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">UX design tools. This project exposed me to a number of different tools that are key to the design process including Balsamiq, draw.io and Sketch.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Following the process. It can sometimes seem tedious to do each little step, but my understanding of user needs and the strength of the final product was greatly improved by working through them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
     <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">What Didn't Work?</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Social login. You see social logins everywhere, but it’s looking like their time has come and gone. Users overwhelmingly did not want to connect social accounts to other products.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Logo creation. The logo was a sticking point in the development of Blocbox. While I’m happy with the final result, I wish I had accepted the simple design sooner instead of trying to create something more complex.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Lessons Learned</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Test and then test more. This has been emphasized throughout the case study, but my experience with the benefits of testing is something I will carry forward with me to any new project I create.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Simple can be better. Not everything has to be complex and ornate. Often a product can be more impactful when it’s clearly focused and easy for any user to identify and understand.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">There’s always room for improvement. Initially the project specs made me questions if Blocbox was worth developing. However, with careful analysis, there are always gaps and deficiencies in other products that can be improved upon.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section" id="last-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Moving Forward</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Through my digital marketing experience, I’ve been involved in many pieces of both the design and development project. However, Blocbox was the first project I completed entirely on my own from start to finish. This was exciting and encouraging for my UX/UI design career going forward. I had a great time with the design process and revealed a career path that was both fun and rewarding.</p>
