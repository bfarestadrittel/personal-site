        Camping is a great way to unplug from technology and connect with nature, but it can be surprisingly difficult to find a place to sleep under the stars.

      <p class="study-copy">
        CampOut was conceived trying to find affordable accomodations for a wedding. After much frustration searching for a camping spot, my friends and I finally caved and payed for a hotel. After a night of sub-par sleeping arrangements in an overpriced room, we started to discuss solutions to make tracking down the perfect camping spot more simple.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        We all know there are thousands of amazing campsites out there, but your casual camper often doesn’t know how to find them. Our informal focus group identified several key issues in the way we plan a camping trip:
      </p>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">I am familiar with campsites in my local area, but searching outside my home state can be difficult when I am not familiar with the area and regulations.</li>
        <li class="problem">Often word of mouth is the best way to find a campsite. There is not a good way for experienced campers to connect and share this information with others.</li>
        <li class="problem">The apps and websites currently available are not interconnected. They focus on only one specific type of campsite, requiring multiple tools to find what you want.</li>
        <li class="problem">Government websites for public lands are often outdated and difficult to use, leading users to give up on the process.</li>
        <li class="problem">The permit process can be incredibly confusing. How do I pay? How do I confirm my reservation? Do I even need a permit? This makes advance planning a real challenge.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        While my focus group had identified a number of problems, I decided to confirm our suspicions with a competitive analysis of several of the most popular camping apps. What I found was expected: outdated designs, limited functionality and little to no user interaction. Information was scattered, and several different apps were required to compare different types of campsites.

    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Stories</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Having surveyed the playing field, functionality was the first place I decided to start. What were the key components a user would want? Based on my research I constructed a series of user stories that would allow me to establish a minimum viable product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-assets"></div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Flows</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">With the essential pieces of functionality identified, I worked to address one of the biggest problems: Camping apps can be confusing and difficult to use. To ensure a streamlined user experience, I developed user flows for each piece of functionality.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Sitemap</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">The pieces were now in place, but they needed to fit together. Before any design work could begin a sitemap was required. This takes all of the potential user flows and fits them together into one cohesive application.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Brand Identity</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Now the fun can begin! What does the CampOut brand look like? To create a brand identity that can drive the overall feel of the app I started sketching out logos and searching for color palettes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Logo Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Enlisting the help of my focus group, the final options were selected based on popular opinion. According to one of the participants, “The simplicity of this logo reminds me of the experience I want to get from camping.” While it would’ve been understandable to go with a forest green theme, focus group participants preferred the purple and orange, noting it reminded them of the early morning and evening skies they’ve experienced on their camping adventures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Build Wireframes</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">With a brand established, it’s time to start building some wireframes for the basic look and feel of the app. These lo-res wireframes were created in Sketch.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Mockup Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Having all of the essential screens accounted for, it’s time to bring them to life. In the design process I focused on solving the problem of camping apps and websites being confusing and outdated. My aim was to make a layout that had a very familiar and intuitive feel to other apps that allow you to search, rate and review.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Prototype</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">The app makes sense to me, but what about potential users? To find out I created a clickable prototype using InVision. Sending it out to friends and family I gathered feedback and made adjustments accordingly.</p>
