      <h2 class="section-title">The Backstory</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        It’s safe to say Americans love beer. There are over 5,300 breweries across the country, with well over 300 in Colorado alone. With such a high concentration of new brews, finding the truly special beers can be a real challenge. My goal with Rare Brew was to create a website that modernized the beer buying process and helped connect beer lovers with rare and limited-release beers they love.
      </p>
      <p class="study-copy">
        To ensure this was a website beer drinkers would use, I first conducted a survey to gauge interest. The results were positive, with 100% of respondents not only drinking beer, but also drinking craft beer. The demand for a site like Rare Brew was clear, with 70% of respondents saying they pursue rare or limited-release beers and would be interested in shopping for them online.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        With a little research it’s easy to find plenty of websites that sell beer. However, after performing a competitive analysis with sites that ranked well for key search terms, there was a lot that could be improved on over what they were currently doing. Some of the key issues included:
      </p>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">The designs of these websites are outdated and ineffective. I don’t trust them as a commerce site.</li>
        <li class="problem">There is not a specific focus on beer. Instead they spread themselves across wine, whiskey, cider, cigars, etc. making the sites difficult to navigate.</li>
        <li class="problem">The checkout process is long and complicated. These forms could be significantly simplified.</li>
        <li class="problem">The amount of information is limited or non-existent. What are the qualities of the beer?</li>
        <li class="problem">Many sites do not offer the opportunity for the community to connect and share feedback through reviews.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Based on my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEf1t4uDiTlDfciIyGCUn_BvsMdMz9aTj2XmVTNWHIY/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/3yvdTeATvuR4bZR32" class="email-link" target="_blank">survey results</a>, I was able to narrow the focus of this project to address the key issues facing other online beer sites. With Rare Brew I aimed to modernize the design, narrow the focus, simplify the checkout process and provide a way to rate and review products.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Stories</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">To inform my design and the flow of the site, I constructed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDsFgeaqDTXQUYnGTyN4h_OSSAYpdNL3jPOu3ue9d6k/edit?usp=sharing" class="email-link" target="_blank">series of user stories</a> focusing on both new and returning users to the site.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">User Flows</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">The user stories are a very helpful part of the design process, helping me think about how users might work their way through the site. From this information I moved to creating draw.io diagrams for the user flows.</p>
      <p class="solution-copy">In my research I found competing websites had an overly-complicated checkout process. To figure out how to improve upon this for Rare Brew, I also <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eWwPvLNw4j4erQFsZUov5fchgF5qrJKn/view" class="email-link" target="_blank">mapped their processes</a> to see what could be eliminated for a more efficient user experience.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Brand Identity</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">Knowing the key areas I intended to improve on and having their user flows constructed, I started to put together the brand identity. My goal was to create a logo more in line with what you would find in microbreweries. Additionally, I wanted to emphasize that the Rare Brew site was making a difficult process easier.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Logo Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">After sketching out some ideas by hand, I started to refine a logo design that looked like it would appear as a label on a beer bottle.</p>
      <img src="css/circle-logo.png" id="user-flow">
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Build Wireframes</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">This project had very defined goals of areas I hoped to improve upon, so I constructed some wireframes in Sketch with the basic navigation layout that could be carried over across the site.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Mockup Design</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">With the layout I wanted to use sitewide established, I moved quickly into the design. The objective was to test the improved checkout and rate and review process to get them into a prototype for user testing.</p>
      <a href="css/rb-mockups.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="css/rb-design-preview.png" id="user-flow"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Prototype</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">With all of the elements of the checkout and review process designed in Sketch, I created an InVision prototype and started gathering feedback.</p>
      <a href="https://invis.io/EHFUWPBJMF4" target="_blank"><img src="css/try-rb.png" id="try-campout"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Results</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        The user input I received really helped me strengthen the design. Comments included:
      </p>
      <p class="study-copy">
        “The navbar is way too big to be as minimal as it is.”
      </p>
      <p class="study-copy">“I wasn’t sure what happened when I clicked the find me a beer area.”</p>
      <p class="study-copy">
        Clearly the main navigation needed some improvement. I reduced the size of the logo and menu bar in order to give the rest of the content more real estate. Additionally, I implemented a super search bar that was significantly more attention grabbing when clicked.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="study-copy">
        The Rare Brew project really helped me refine my design process. These are some of the things I learned and how I will approach projects in the future.

    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">What Worked?</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Competitive analysis. Digging deep into competitor websites helped me create a stronger design, add new features and improve user experience.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">User feedback. Getting consistent feedback about specific aspects of the design showed how important it is to listen to users throughout the process.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Industry research. Reviewing modern brewery websites provided a lot of inspiration for product presentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
     <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">What Didn't Work?</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Wireframing. I found myself spending more time in the design process because I didn’t create wireframes for all the pieces.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Sizing. With user feedback I found that a lot of things felt too large. In the future I would do a preference test earlier in the process.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Lessons Learned</h3>
      <ul class="problems">
        <li class="problem">Wireframe everything. Getting that skeleton in place makes the process much more smooth. Because I was focusing on improving specific processes, I didn’t go beyond the basic elements and paid for it a bit.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Research is your friend. Analyzing competitors helped me identify and target specific features to improve on. Spending the time to know the industry is 100% worth it.
        </li>
        <li class="problem">Embrace user feedback. It’s not always easy to hear someone doesn’t like something you’ve worked hard on, but it helped me create a significantly stronger product.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-section" id="last-section">
      <h3 class="solution-title">Moving Forward</h3>
      <p class="solution-copy">The Rare Brew project is what helped me shape my design process. Structure is key for me, so going forward I will move through each element step-by-step before jumping into the full design. At the same time, I will continue to collect feedback as I work so those small adjustments can be made earlier in the process.</p>
